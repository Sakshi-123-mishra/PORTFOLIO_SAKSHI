# Contributing

This is a personal portfolio website. It is not accepting contributions at this time.

If you find any issues or have feedback, feel free to reach out through the contact form on the website.
- Write and update tests.
- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocked you.
